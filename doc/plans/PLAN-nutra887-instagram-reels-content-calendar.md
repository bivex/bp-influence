# Nutra 887 Instagram Reels Content Calendar

**Campaign**: Nutra 887 Launch - "Wellness Your Way"
**Platform**: Instagram Reels
**Campaign Period**: 8 weeks (2 weeks pre-launch + 4 weeks launch + 2 weeks sustain)
**Date**: February 2025
**Status**: Draft Content Calendar

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the day-by-day Instagram Reels content strategy for Nutra 887, designed as a complementary but distinct execution from the TikTok campaign. While TikTok focuses on native, educational wellness content, Instagram Reels will leverage the platform's visual storytelling strengths, polished aesthetic, and shoppable integration to drive consideration and conversion.

**Key Differentiators from TikTok**:
- **Visual Polish**: Instagram audience expects higher production value
- **Shoppability**: Native product tagging and direct checkout integration
- **Feed-First Strategy**: Reels amplify feed content, not standalone
- **Lifestyle Integration**: Strong emphasis on aesthetic lifestyle integration
- **Collection Building**: Content designed for saving and organizing

| **Conversion** | 5% | 15% | 30% | 15% |
| **Community** | 0% | 0% | 10% | 5% |

### Content Variety by Platform Strength

| Instagram Reels Strength | Content Application |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| **Visual Aesthetics** | Higher production value, color consistency, brand feel |
| **Shoppability** | Product tags, "shop the look", routine showcases |
| **Feed Integration** | Reels amplify feed content, not standalone |
| **Save/Collection Culture** | Reference-worthy content, "save for later" hooks |
| **Lifestyle Aspiration** | More polished lifestyle integration vs TikTok's raw authenticity |

### Pacing of Promotional vs. Value-Based Content

**The 80/20 → 60/40 → 40/60 Graduation**:

1. **Weeks 1-2**: 80% value / 20% promotional (build trust first)
2. **Weeks 3-4**: 60% value / 40% promotional (transition period)
3. **Weeks 5-6**: 40% value / 60% promotional (conversion focus, value maintained)

**"Value" Content Definition**:

- Entertainment (engaging, share-worthy)
- Community (feel connected)
- Inspiration (motivated, aspirational)

**"Promotional" Content Definition**:
- Direct CTAs (shop now, use code, link in bio)
- Product showcases with strong sales angle
- Urgency/scarcity messaging
- Price/promo focus

### Conversion CTA Introduction Timeline

| **Days 43-56** | Direct | Conversion | "Shop Nutra 887 with code XX — launch discount ends soon" |

**CTA Avoidance Window**: Days 1-14 (trust building phase, no direct selling)

---

## 4. Cross-Platform Strategy

### Instagram Reels vs. TikTok: Key Differences

| Aspect | TikTok | Instagram Reels | Implication |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Audience Expectation** | Raw, authentic, unpolished | Polished, aesthetic, curated | Reels need higher production value |
| **Algorithm Behavior** | FYP-driven discovery | Follower + Explore + feed | Reels amplify existing presence more |
| **Content Style** | Educational, authentic, trend-heavy | Lifestyle, aspirational, aesthetic | More lifestyle integration on Reels |
| **Discovery Mechanism** | Sound + FYP | Hashtags + Explore + Sound | Hashtags more critical on Reels |
| **Shopping** | Limited | Native product tags | Prioritize shoppability on Reels |
| **Save Culture** | Strong | Very strong | Design for saves on Reels |

### Cross-Platform Content Map

| Original Content (TikTok) | Instagram Reels Adaptation | Format Changes | Timeline |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Ingredient education (green screen) | Ingredient spotlight with product tags | Add product tag, higher production | Same day |
| Routine integration (day in life) | Lifestyle routine showcase | More polished, aesthetic focus | +1 day |
| Honest testimonial (authentic) | Social proof testimonial | Slight polish, maintain authenticity | +1 day |
| Myth-busting educational | Myth vs truth graphic | Enhanced graphics, cleaner editing | +1 day |
| "I was skeptical" narrative | "Why I switched" showcase | More lifestyle framing | +1 day |
| UGC compilation (multiple creators) | Community highlights reel | Polished compilation, branded | +2 days |
| TikTok LIVE clips | LIVE recap Reel with product tags | Product tag addition, CTA | +1 day |
| Top-performing TikTok | Paid Spark/Reels ad adaptation | Ad overlay, strong CTA | +3 days for paid |

### Platform-Specific Content Not to Cross-Post

| Content | TikTok Only | Instagram Only | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Raw, unpolished talking head** | ✅ | ❌ | Instagram expects polish |
| **Trend-heavy audio without brand relevance** | ✅ | ❌ | Less trend-dependent on Reels |
| **Highly aesthetic lifestyle shoots** | ❌ | ✅ | Feels inauthentic on TikTok |
| **Product tags and shoppable content** | ⚠️ Limited | ✅ | Native to Instagram |
| **Behind-the-scenes "messy" content** | ✅ | ⚠️ Careful | Instagram more curated |
| **Feed-amplifying content** | ❌ | ✅ | Unique to Instagram |

### Coordination Strategy: TikTok → Instagram Flow

**Daily Publishing Sequence**:
1. **TikTok publishes first** (morning, 7-8 AM)
2. **Instagram Reel publishes same day or next morning** (if adapting)
3. **Instagram Stories cross-promote both** (day of and day after)
4. **Feed post amplifies top Reel** (within 48 hours)

**Content Adaptation Process**:
1. **Review TikTok performance** (within 6 hours)
2. **Top performers identified for Reels adaptation**
3. **Format adapted for Instagram aesthetics**
4. **Product tags, shopping features added**
5. **Published 24-48 hours after original TikTok**

**Avoid**: Simply reposting identical content to both platforms without adaptation

## 5. Caption Strategy by Phase

### Caption Framework

**All captions follow this structure**:

```
[HOOK — First line, attention-grabbing]

[VALUE — What they'll learn/experience]

[PERSONAL TOUCH — Creator's genuine experience]

[DISCLOSURE — Clear #ad/#sponsored]

[CTA — Specific next step]

[HASHTAGS — 3-5 relevant, 1 campaign]
```

### Caption Examples by Phase

**Pre-Launch Caption (Day 1)**:
```
If you've ever spent 20 minutes reading supplement labels and felt more confused than when you started... this is for you.

We need to talk about why something as simple as knowing what's in your supplements feels so impossible.

I've been diving deep into supplement transparency lately and what I've learned has been eye-opening.

#ad — Paid partnership with @nutra887

More coming soon. What questions do you have about supplements?

#supplements #wellness #wellnessjourney #Nutra887Way
```

**Launch Caption (Day 15)**:
```
This is what transparency actually looks like.

After [X years/months] of searching for a supplement that actually tells me what's inside — I found it.

I've been testing Nutra 887 for [timeframe] and the difference is in what you DON'T see: hidden ingredients, proprietary blends, and vague claims.

#ad Paid partnership with @nutra887

Link in bio to shop + use code [CODE] for 15% off. Limited time.

#wellnessfinds #supplements #wellnessroutine #Nutra887Way

After [timeframe] of testing, here's my honest assessment: [specific results, no guarantees, your experience may vary].

The launch discount is ending soon — this is what I'd tell a friend considering it.

## 7. Visual Direction & Style Guide

### Visual Standards by Platform

| Element | TikTok | Instagram Reels |
|---------|--------|-----------------|

## 10. Platform-Specific Best Practices

### Instagram Reels Optimization

**Algorithm Signals**:
- **Watch time**: 15-30 second optimal, front-load hook
- **Re-watch value**: Educational content, transformations
- **Shares**: Create "send this to a friend" moments
- **Saves**: Make content reference-worthy (routines, guides)
- **Comments**: Ask questions, prompt discussion
- **Audio**: Use trending audio + original audio option

**Reels-Specific Features**:
- **Product tags**: Use on all appropriate content (conversion posts)
- **Collab posts**: For creator-creator content (community building)
- **Story integration**: Always post Story driving to Reel (day of)
- **Feed amplification**: Top Reels to feed within 48 hours
- **Save collections**: Design content to be saved (reference value)

**Caption Best Practices**:
- First line = hook (make it compelling)
- Value in first 2 lines (above "more" fold)
- Personal touch = authenticity
- Disclosure line clearly separate
- CTA specific (not just "link in bio")
- Hashtags: 3-5 relevant, 1 campaign

### TikTok vs. Reels: Content Conversion Rules

**TikTok → Reels Adaptation Checklist**:
- [ ] Review performance data (is it worth adapting?)
- [ ] Enhance visual polish (lighting, transitions, color)
- [ ] Add product tags (if shoppable)
- [ ] Adapt caption for Instagram style (slightly more formal)
- [ ] Adjust hashtags (Instagram mix)
- [ ] Consider Story cross-promotion strategy
- [ ] Plan feed amplification if performance strong

**Reels → TikTok Adaptation Checklist**:
- [ ] Strip back polish (make more authentic/raw)
- [ ] Simplify caption (TikTok style)
- [ ] Adjust hashtags (TikTok niche focus)
- [ ] Consider audio (trending vs original)
- [ ] Ensure platform-native feel (not obvious cross-post)
