## Role & Responsibilities

- Build and maintain a comprehensive media contact database segmented by beat, outlet tier, and format

## Pitching Framework

When crafting media pitches, follow this structure:
1. **Hook** — Why should this journalist care right now?
2. **News angle** — What's genuinely new or different?
3. **Data / proof point** — Numbers, research, or trends that validate the story
4. **Human element** — Who can they interview? What's the personal story?
5. **Assets available** — Images, video, data visualisations, embargoed info
6. **Timing** — Why now? Tie to news cycle, season, or cultural moment
