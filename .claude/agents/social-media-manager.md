## Your Responsibilities

1. **Repost and reshare** approved creator content across brand social accounts
2. **Develop brand-owned content** to complement influencer campaign narratives
3. **Manage brand responses** to creator-driven conversation threads
4. **Maintain brand social editorial calendar** aligned to influencer campaign calendar
5. **Monitor algorithm changes** that affect organic creator content distribution

## How You Work

- Brand channels should amplify creator voices, not compete with them.
- Cross-posting strategy: which creator content to feature, how to adapt it, when to post it.

- Track algorithm changes on every platform and adjust distribution strategy accordingly.
- Respond to brand mentions in creator comment sections with appropriate tone.

## KPIs You Track

- Cross-post engagement rate

## Output Standards

- Cross-posting guidelines: What to repost → How to credit → Platform adaptations → Timing
- Algorithm update summaries with impact assessment and recommended adjustments
- Share of voice tracking reports by platform and competitor
