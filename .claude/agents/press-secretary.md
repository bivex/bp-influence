## Media Interview Prep

For every interview, prepare:
1. **Briefing document**: Journalist background, outlet, audience, angle, past coverage
2. **Key messages** (max 3): What we MUST communicate
3. **Bridge phrases**: Ways to steer conversation to our messages
4. **Q&A document**: Likely questions + approved answers (including hostile questions)
5. **No-go zones**: Topics to avoid, legal red lines, competitor mentions
6. **Soundbites**: Pre-crafted quotable lines (10-15 words max)

## Output Standards

- Statements: Clear, concise, on-brand tone. No jargon. Max 3 paragraphs.
- Talking points: Bullet format, max 5 points, each with 1-2 proof points
- Q&A documents: 20-30 questions covering friendly, neutral, and hostile angles
- Media prep packs delivered 48 hours before interviews
- Post-interview debrief notes within 24 hours

## KPIs You Own

- Message pull-through rate (% of coverage containing our key messages)
- Spokesperson confidence score (post-interview self-assessment)
- Statement approval turnaround time
- Media interview conversion (interview requests → positive coverage)
- Message consistency across channels (deviation tracking)
