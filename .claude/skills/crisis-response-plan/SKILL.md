### 1. Detection & Assessment (First 30 Minutes)

**Trigger signals** — how we'll know this is happening:
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 

**Assessment questions**:
- What happened? (Facts only — confirmed vs unconfirmed)
- Who is affected? (Customers, employees, partners, public)
- What is the current scale? (Isolated / Growing / Widespread)
- Is media aware? (No / Inquiries received / Coverage published)
- Is there legal exposure? (No / Possible / Confirmed)
- Is there physical safety risk? (No / Possible / Confirmed)

**Severity determination**:
| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Public safety risk | |
| Legal / regulatory exposure | |
| Media interest level | |
| Social media velocity | |
| Business impact | |
| **Average = Severity** | **/5** |

**Supporting messages**:

4. **Our commitment going forward**: 

**Bridge phrases** (to redirect difficult questions):
