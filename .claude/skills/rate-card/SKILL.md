### Rate Evaluation Framework

**Assessing if a rate quote is fair:**

| Factor | Below market | Fair | Above market |
|--------|------------|------|-------------|
| CPM (cost per 1K followers) | <$5 | $5-15 | >$15 |
| CPE (cost per engagement) | <$0.05 | $0.05-0.50 | >$0.50 |
| CPV (cost per view) | <$0.01 | $0.01-0.05 | >$0.05 |
| Cost per deliverable vs benchmark | <75% of range | 75-125% | >125% |

**Negotiation levers** (ways to reduce cost without lowering the rate):
1. Multi-post packages (volume discount: 10-20%)
2. Long-term retainer (3-6 months: 15-25% discount)
3. Performance-based component (lower base + bonus at KPI)
4. Product exchange / gifting offset
5. First-partnership trial rate (with option to extend)
6. Content licensing trade (free usage rights in exchange for higher base)
7. Cross-platform bundles

### Notes
- Rates vary significantly by niche (finance, beauty, tech command premiums)
- Rates are 20-40% higher in US/UK vs other English-speaking markets
- Celebrity / talent agency creators often 2-5× above standard rates
- Always benchmark against the creator's actual performance, not just follower count
- CPM based on average reach is more accurate than follower-based pricing
